# file handling
My repository for file handling scripts, a very common task in most programming workflows. The initially intended purpose is as a `git submodule` within my other git repositories, simplifying the usual file handling tasks. For a foolproof introduction to handling `git submodule`s, watch this youtube video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJrh5IjWSGM> ("Add git submodules to GitHub example").

Currently implemented programming languages:
- python (`.py`)
- ImageJ Macro (`.ijm`) - just enough to fit my Fiji needs, not very sophisticated / extendable.
