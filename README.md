# file handling
My repository for file handling scripts, a very common task in most programming workflows. The initially intended purpose is as a `git submodule` within my other git repositories, simplifying the usual file handling tasks.

Currently implemented programming languages:
- python (`.py`)
- ImageJ Macro (`.ijm`) - just enough to fit my Fiji needs, not very sophisticated / extendable.
